# Create Web App:
Welcome to Create Web App, the purpose is to remove the strain of creating all the boilerplate
for a new web project. Simply pick what initial setup you desire, install any additional tools
you would like to use, npm install, git init if you desire, and start coding!

## Troubleshooting
  Ensure you have python installed on your device, you can check in the shell/cmd prompt with "python --version" and you can run "npm install python" if you don't have it
  If you encounter any "ModuleNotFound" errors, in your shell run: "npm install pip", then "pip install psycopg2 PyInquirer". If you still have these errors, cd into the psycopg2-2.8.4 folder and run "python setup.py install", then into the PyInquirer-1.0.3 and again run "python setup.py install"
  Ensure you are not trying to make a project with a project name that you already have as a folder. In some cases, a failed attempt might leave a folder created named by your inputted project name. Delete the project folder create-web-app created (ensure you're not deleting any previous projects) and try again.
If there are any issues, please describe the problem, the stacktrace that was given (if one was), and what steps you took before the problem occurred to randydxp@gmail.com.
